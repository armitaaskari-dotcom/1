        <h1>I am Armita!</h1>
        
        <h2>she/her</h2>
        <p>I’m a self-taught graphic designer and painter, and art
            <br>has been a big part of my life since I was a kid.
            <br>For me, it’s the best way to express myself without
            <br>having to say a word. Nature inspires me the most—its shapes, colors, 
            <br>and textures always find their way into my work. 
            <br>Whenever I feel stuck or run out of ideas, I like to go
            <br>for a walk on a trail or spend some time by the beach to recharge and get inspired again. </p>
    
        <p><strong>I love making arts</strong></p>
        <p><em>This is me hehe!</em></p>
